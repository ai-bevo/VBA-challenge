Bootcamp Module 2 Challenge

This project is intended to analyze three years of stock market data.
The VBA script within the Excel file is titled 'Module 1'. The Excel file was not uploaded per the instructions, also the file size is larger than recommened for Github.
As requested, a separate copy of the VBA script is also included and titled 'Module 1 - VBA Challenge_Allan Ivey.bas'

The script will pull the individual stock ticker values, the high/low from the calendar year. Then it will compute the dollar change in price, the percent change, and the total volume of shares traded for that year. Then it will analyze the calculated stock data and pull out the high/low and largest volume stock for the given year.

Finally, it will loop through each worksheet to repeat these tasks for each year of data provided.
